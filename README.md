[Huff](https://github.com/huff-language) Smart Contracts for creating Metamorphic (or "redeployable") EVM Contracts.

> **Note**
> This is a rewrite of [0age](https://github.com/0age)'s [metamorphic contracts](https://github.com/0age/metamorphic) in [Huff](https://github.com/huff-language).


### A Trip Down Ethereum History

Prior to [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) (included in the Constantinople hard fork), contracts on ethereum were _completely_ immutable. Code deployed to a given address could only be created and subsequently destroyed using the `CREATE` and `SELFDESTRUCT` opcodes. Migrating contracts involved replaying state onto a new contract, which is expensive and not scalable.

Fortunately, [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) introduced the `CREATE2` opcode, a form of ["wild magic"](https://medium.com/@jason.carver/defend-against-wild-magic-in-the-next-ethereum-upgrade-b008247839d2) allowing a contract to be **redeployed to the same address with different bytecode**.

`CREATE2` uses the **callerâ€™s address**, a supplied **salt** parameter, and the **initialization code** of the contract that is created. Altering any one of these parameters will result in your bytecode being deployed to a completely different contract address.

Cool, so we have completely deterministic, redeployable contracts on Ethereum using `CREATE2`, right?

Well, this fails if the initialization code of the contract is non-deterministic. [0age](https://github.com/0age) presents a simple example: consider a contract that calls into some external contract and uses the variable return data to construct the final bytecode. Then the initialization code is in fact non-deterministic, and `CREATE2` will generate an entirely new address for each time the contract is redeployed if the return data from the external contract changes.

### Usage

**Deploying Metamorphic Contracts**

// TODO:

Clone factory contracts should use the [`HuffCloneLib`](src/HuffCloneLib.huff) library. `CLONE` is the main macro for creating clones.

Contracts intended to be cloned should include [`HuffClone`](src/HuffClone.huff) to get access to the helper macros for reading immutable args.

To see an example usage of the library, check out [`ExampleClone`](src/ExampleClone.huff) and [`ExampleCloneFactory`](src/ExampleCloneFactory.huff).

**Installing as a Foundry Library**

To install with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry):

```
forge install abigger87/metamorphic
```
